TRIANGLE TRACKER
Description

The triangle tracker web page allows user to input the lengths of the sides of a triangle, and returns whether these sides form an equilateral, isosceles, or scalene triangle or if the sides cannot make a triangle at all.This project is part of the exercises used to test my understanding of JavaScript as part of my coursework at Moringa School.
